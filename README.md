# Pay-It-Forward
Compulsory Task created as per the requirements of level 2 of the graduate program

## Project Details
### Description:
Create a menu program that will allow customers to select appropriately from 3 types of available movie tickets

### Functionality:
This program runs continuously with no exit option from the loop, similar to those found at the likes of Ster Kinkor and Nu Metro. It allows users to select tickets of their choice. The Menu Class contains the main method through which all other classes and functions are called based on user input. The Choice Class houses the various methods to be called to calculate ticket prices and request user confirmation. The inputValid Class is used to handle unexpected user input and keep the menu going.

### Usefulness:
This program is designed to be used as an assignment for software engineering bootcamp students. It does not have to be used in its entirety. Several simpler tasks could be based on specific elements from within this task if, for example, you wanted to present the student with a shorter challenge that focused on concepts such as loops, exception handling, OOP, etc.

### Contributors:
This was a solo project as a requirement for level 2 of the graduate program for the Hyperion bootcamp. 

### Project Status:
There will likely be no more updates on this project provided the Hyperion Reviewers grant their approval
